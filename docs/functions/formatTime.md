## Example Usage

```grimoire
var timestamp: uint = 1620954321;
var formattedTime: string = formatTime("yyyy-mm-dd HH:ii:ss", timestamp);
```

In the example above, the `formatTime` function is called with a Unix timestamp and a format string of `"yyyy-mm-dd HH:ii:ss"`. This format string will result in a time string like `"2021-05-14 10:25:21"`.

## Notes

- The format options allow you to customize the output format according to your requirements.
- It is important to ensure that the format string is constructed correctly to match the desired output.
